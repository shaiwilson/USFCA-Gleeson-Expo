      <h1 class="chain">An Ode to Architecture</h1>
      <p class="text-intro">Visitors attended the exposition to see some landmarks that they’ve thus far only read or heard about through newspapers and media. Aside from creating the massive exhibition space, a massive assortment of installations furnished the 8 exhibition halls of the Exposition. These attractions were meant to transport visitors to parts of the world hitherto unknown and inaccessible. Full scale recreations of natural and architectural feats were displayed, these included f Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park, a working model of the Panama Canal, and a replica of the Greek Parthenon. Even though these attractions were made of temporary materials meant to last only year, the architects did not hold back. Although the Exposition itself was demolished and left to ruins after its close, these buildings are fascinating reminders of how we used to think. They are fantasies that represented possibilities and hope for the future. They were attempts to show off and also pay homage to a meaningful building heritage and tradition.</p>

        <p>The Palace of Horticulture was remarkable for its green glass dome, larger than that of St.Peter’s Basilica in Rome. At the time of the Exposition, the Palace loomed over a five acre area and housed a magnificent tropical display that allowed visitors insights into the study of rare fruits, plants, and botany.</p>

        <p>From an achitectural viewpoint the dominating feature of the Panama-Pacific Exposition is the great Tower of Jewels which occupied the center of the large courtyard. Standing 43 floors high, the Tower's exterior was decorated with more than 100,000 glass beads of various colors, which were strung on wires so they would blow in the wind.</p>

        <p>Widely considered the most beautiful structure at the exhibition, the Palace of Fine Arts — housing art from Renaissance to Modern — was the work of California architect Bernard Maybeck. The Corinthian colonnade and Romanesque rotunda of the Palace of Fine Arts were originally framed in wood, then covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber. </p>

              <p class="twitter-post">"It is this self-conscious "artifice of eternity," created by a rare collaboration of artists, engineers, gardeners, businessmen and politicians, that accounted for the unanimous love that the fair inspired and the vivid memories it engendered even in toddlers. Far more than Disneyland, or anything else since 1915, it seems to have been a magic kingdom whose power lay in its evocation of time as well as of place."</p>

You could see it all -- the sullen blue-green of the Presidio forest... the gray-veiled city... the silver of the gleaming bay... the purple majesty of the far mountains, the tender green of the Marin hills... and the Exposition's city of delight."</p>
