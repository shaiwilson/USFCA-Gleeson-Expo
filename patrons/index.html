        <p class="text-intro">The Panama Pacific Exposition Company was held to the task of assembling a team of the best architects, designers, artists, and engineers from around the country to create a design worthy of a grand presentation of artistry and achievement. A big hurdle for the designers of the Exposition was the challenge to create a cohesive design that would bring together the various structures and exhibits under an underlying idea. The Exposition had to accomodate monumental structures, diverse exhibitions, and thousands of visitors; it had to be efficient and theatrical; and it had to complement the natural beauty of the San Francisco Bay.

Born in New York in 1862, Maybeck spent five years studying architecture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France before setting up shop in Berkeley in 1890. Bernard believed that architecture here in California, to qualify as beautiful, needed only to be an effective background for landscape. Architects and historians alike agree that Maybeck was able to achieve this end in his Palace design as it continues to complement the natural beauty of the San Francisco Bay.">
