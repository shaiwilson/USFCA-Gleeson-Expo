          <p class="text-intro"> Sculpture is one of the legacies of the Exposition. The sculptures that stood on columns, on top of building, in niches, in fountains, in exhibit halls and on pedestals of their own were the gateway to the long lasting recognition of California artists and their work. Held to both international and national acclaim, the art activities in California were hailed in part by the success of the art program at the PPIE. In preparation for the exposition, artist worked tirelessly to construct over 1,500 individual sculptures with wood, wire and a faux marble material. The Palace of Fine arts was perhaps the most notable gallery site at the exposition. By virtue of Alexander Stirling Calder, chief of sculpture, more than fifteen hundred sculptures from artists around the world were commissioned for the purpose of this exposition. </p>

          <h2>The Rising and Setting Sun</h2>
          <p>In the center of the Court of the Universe stand two friezes known as the Rising and Setting sun. The Rising Sun stands for hope, faith, courage, inspiration and renewed vigor, themes that we associate with the sunrise. The Setting sun, a graceful, female figure is like a column of soft and comforting twilight foreshadowing night fall.</p>

          <h2>The Thinker</h2>
          <p> Few sculptures are as iconic as Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. The depiction of a nude man hunched over in apparent thought was originally part of Rodinâ€™s The Gates of Hell. Standing nearly 20 feet tall, the work was meant to capture the sudden rupture of emotion and introspection. In his lifetime, Rodin made at least 10 castings of The Thinker. Today, a caste of The Thinker can be viewed at the gates of the San Francisco Legion of Honor.</p>

          <p>The fountain has a double significance. In the first aspect it records the conquest by Energy of the labors of the Canal. In the second it proclaims the approach of vigor for the future.</p>
