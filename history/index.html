					<p>The history of the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exhibition is, in a sense, the history of the transformation of San Francisco. A statement about how the promise of tomorrow would re-build the debris of the past. It was and remains a cultural icon of a period of innovation and possibilities that lies at the heart of San Francisco. </p>
                    
                    
					<p>On February 20, 1915, the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco opened its gates to the world to celebrate the completion of the Panama Canal. San Francisco as a city had just recovered from the devastating earthquake and fire in 1906 which wiped out most of the city and the PPIE was the prime time to prove that it had bounced back remarkably.</p>
					<p>The Exposition took place on 630 acres of marsh in between Fort Mason through the Presidio in what is now known as the Marina District from February until December 1915. Built, over the course of three years and at a total construction cost of $15 million dollars, over twenty foreign nations and forty-three states participated in the Exposition which had attracted 19 million visitors by closing day.</p>
	
					<a name="history"><h3>The World Fair</h3></a>
					<p>London inaugurated the first World Fair in 1851 and Paris soon followed in 1889. Today, London's Crystal Palace and Paris' Eiffel Tower are iconic reminders — like our Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District — of past expositions. Many of the massive world’s fairs of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were a showcase to promote certain objectives. Seattle's 1962 Space Needle celebrated modernism. San Francisco's 1915 exposition celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal, but it was also about San Francisco's triumphant rise from the 1906 earthquake and fire. The fairgrounds were called, The Jewel City. And yet, the Panama Pacific International Exposition celebrated much more: it brought diverse communities of people together and urged us not to look back, but to take one step closer into the future. </p>
					<a name="opening"><h3>Opening Day</h3></a>
					<p>World Fairs are meant primarily to entertain but they are also geared towards educating and showcasing new inventions and future possibilities: it's a place to learn.</p>
                    
					<h3>You're Invited</h3>
					<p>Here is a snippet from the official brochure of the PPPIE titled, Information for Visitors to the
Panama-Pacific International Exposition.</p>
					<p>"To this Panama-Pacific International Exposition - fit in its manifold marvels to celebrate man's crowning achievement over Nature's most stubborn and malignant forces - San Francisco bids the world. The welcome is not the timorous invitation of a debutante in the world's experience, nor boastful like an impulsive youth's; it is confident and hearty, for its security rests in the attainments of a past that is rich in romance-with its Spanish Portolas, its English Drakes, its siestas of early years. San Francisco is bold with the heritage of pioneer builders, hardy frontiersmen and their wonderful women. She is calm with recent triumphs over a disaster that staggered the world with its fiery magnitude, and is optimistic with hope grounded deep in a history wherein is seen that all things have, indeed, worked together for good. In such a spirit does San Francisco offer the world a Western welcome." </p>

					<a name="visions"><h3>A Phoenix Rising</h3></a>
					<p>As the story goes, the phoenix is a mythical bird with fiery feathers that lives up to 100 years. Near the end of its life, it settles into its nest of twigs which then burns, reducing the bird and nest to ashes. And from those ashes, a phoenix rises – renewed and reborn.</p>
					<p>Looking at the prosperity of San Francisco today, with its peaceful and graceful architecture, it’s impressive skyline, it’s well-preserved cultural heritage, it’s hard to imagine that this city could hide a history brimming with near-escaped from financial ruin and natural disasters. But this is the hidden story of San Francisco — a tale of visionaries, dreamers and risk-takers who profoundly influenced movements in design, art, architecture, technology, and business that would shape the legacy and future of San Francisco.

					<a name="exhibition"><h3>Celebrating 100 years of Pride and Unity</h3></a>
					<p>While the Palace of Fine Arts is the only remaining building left in the same position from the PPIE there are still plenty of artifacts that exist. Many are on display during San Francisco's year-long celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the PPIE. </p>
					             
					<p>Among the exhibits in San Francisco, students from the University of San Francisco's Museum Studies class are pleased to invite you to an exhibition in USF's Gleeson Rare Book Room that looks at the wide variety of USF's own PPIE material. Starting May 1st, 2015 the exhibit is open to the public. Focusing on both the macro and micro sides of PPIE's history, particularly the experience of San Francisco visitors and the impact of the PPIE within the San Francisco community. For more, check out the University of San Francisco Gleeson Rare Book Room website for information on exhibition hours.
